# Lorcana Booster Pack

Having recently gotten a friend into Lorcana via PixelBorn, he wanted a way to get started with deck building, without focusing narrowly on meta decks or having to spend money on booster packs.

I built this utility to draw a pack of 12 random cards, based on the same odds as pulling cards in a real booster pack, using the figures found [here](https://lorcanaplayer.com/lorcana-card-rarities-pull-rates-holo-foils/): 

    6 Common cards
    3 Uncommon cards
    2 Rare, Super Rare, or Legendary cards – Both Non-Foil
    1 Foil Card – This could be of any rarity from Common to Enchanted
