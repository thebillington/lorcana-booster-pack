# Lorcana Booster Pack

Having recently gotten a friend into Lorcana via PixelBorn, he wanted a way to get started with deck building, without focusing narrowly on meta decks or having to spend money on booster packs.

I built this utility to draw a pack of 12 random cards, based on the same odds as pulling cards in a real booster pack, using the figures found [here](https://www.digitaltq.com/the-first-chapter-pull-rates-disney-lorcana-tcg) as a guide. This isn't anywhere close to exact, but a decent enough approximation based on the 384 booster packs that the author of that page opened.
